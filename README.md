## Angular code

Found in src/
Angular serves our front end, starting from index.html. The custom tags, starting with <app-root>, link to components, which are web page pieces that come in and out as the user navigates the site. This is why angular apps are usually called "single-page" apps.
<app-root> code can be found in src/app.component.html (component files always have .component. in them, just like service files, which handle background information, always have .service. in them)
